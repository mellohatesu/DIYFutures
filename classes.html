        <p>Okay so, I've been floating in and out of departments for my first two years here, but now it's time to lock in lowkey lol. I started in the Sound Department, then went to Designed Objects for some reason ROFL, no shade btw I took the class because I really wanted to be like y'all. And now I'm back in Art&Tech and so I think I'll stay and hone in my skills with Sound Art and Web Art. I'm not entirely sure what I was doing or wanted to do, but I know I really want to keep exploring modern and retro technology and harnessing their power to enhance every aspect of my performance and music career. (´ ω `♡) </p>
        <br>
        <p>Alright, let's dive in, I'll seperate each semester with a little description of what I want to do either in-between or with the classes I am taking at SAIC, and also want to give some input on what I want to be doing sonically at the time as well. </p>

                <li>UI / UX Responsive Web Design <em>w/ John Bowers</em></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This summmer I want to hone in some of my visual communication skills, If I could go back in time I might have just jumped into the visom department as a freshman, but now that I am about to enter my Junior year, I'm gonna do all I can to build up a strong portfolio for web design. I hope in this class I can learn some essential composition skills, as well as get critiqued so I can come out shining and glowing with knowledge. </br>(￣ε￣＠)</p>

        <p>Alright, here's the first big one (；⌣̀_⌣́)</p>
        <div class="infoText">

                <ul>

                    <li> Worlds Collide! The Architecture of Science Fiction<em>w/ John Bowers</em></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>This semester seems like it will probably be the most jampacked one I'll be in. I was able to email into the Web Design class, so I will have to prove to myself and to the professor that I do deserve to be in that class. The Max/MSP course looks very enticing, and I want to make my own sort of muisc using my Art&Technology knowledge. Like I said prior, I really want to up my game, and knowing the history of Sonic art will porbably provide great inspiration for that as well. Overall looks like it'll be a semester to give it my all.</br>(〃￣ω￣〃ゞ)</p>

            <p>This semester, I get to reap the benefits of my AP classes, and only take four classes. This will be hopefully a more relaxed semester so I'll be able to focus on personal projects, such as DJing and the Mello Jupiter project. By this time I'll hopefully have another project out, as I aim to make at least one each year.  </br>(￣ω￣;)</p>

                <p>With the extra time I had in my Spring semester, I believe I'll be able to find an internship I can take a part of over the Summer. I've taken a look at handshake a couple times, and have seen a good amount of internships within the music industry. The United Music group had internships available, as well as Warner Bros. and deadAir Records. These internships are the ones I'll most likely get into considering my background, and want to aim to either do it over Winter '24 or Summer '25 </br>(・`ω´・)</p>

            <p>Following the trend of busy Fall Semesters, this will be the first semester of my senior year, and I hope I'll have my internship credits by now or at least taking them this semester. I'll be back to 5 classes this semester, these classes are around my practice, so I won't be overexerting my creativity. Honestly I want to take as many classes that align with the stuff I make outside of school, so I can use it as releases, or at least let me develop some ideas for my personal practice and it has deemed to be very successful and what I truly want to spend most of my time doing. </br>┐(︶▽︶)┌</p>

            <p>My final semester as an undergrad the SAIC, I still want to go as hard as I can and continue to create thigns I can show off in some sort of online portfolio. These classes are not the most intesive, so with my prior knowledge I'll be able to use the resources provided by those classes to contiue some personal projects, as well as broaden my horizions and meet more students and alumni. Other than that, I hope I manage to get all my credits-- Goodbye SAIC....</br>( ´ ω ` )ノﾞ</p>
