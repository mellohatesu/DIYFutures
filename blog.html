    <p>Just an area for me to talk about professors I want to work with, goals for the future, how I feel as an artist right now, and where I want to be in the future. I don't think I want to do any abroad traveling, or any Ox-Bow courses, so hopefully this in-depth talk will suffice.</p>

    <h2>Introspection & Reflection</h2>
    <p class="yapping">In regards to my experience at this school and knowledge related to my practice, I truly do not know enough to sit comfortably as an artist right now. I feel like I am floating between departments within this school structure, which is a bit scary considering I can take any class I would like (granted I have the prerequisite requirements). With so many options regarding the path I can take as an artist, I find myself overwhelmed— but I will not falter. As an electronic musician, I think it is necessary to take my art to another step, where someone like a painter would not have to transcend their work, I think in order to succeed I have to take my medium to another level. 

        For what I do not know, perhaps learning how to create instruments in order to give a more tactile element to my work, learning how to engineer my own synths, or drum machines may be a cool thing to explore. ☆⌒(≧▽​° )
        
        During school I’ve struggled getting critique and in-depth help within my sound design and composition, mostly because I feel like my medium is a bit more niche at this school. It’s always a struggle to gain good insight, but recently I’ve been delightfully surprised that people within my sophomore seminar class gave very good feedback on one of my recent pieces.
        
        I think a lot of it boils down to just not knowing my place in the realm of being an artist. I want to be a lot, and yet master everything which is just a difficult thing to do to begin with. Hopefully I’ll be able to expand my craft to engineer more and make digital spaces as well.</p>

        <h2>Faculty & Class Reasoning</h2>
        <p class="yapping">
            As of right now, I think learning more computer science skills will most benefit me into learning how to build my own sonic equipment, as well as being able to visually communicate my ideas better will be able to help me get to the point of artistry I would like to be at. As of right now, I have an intermediate level of knowledge between HTML and CSS, with JavaScript being my weakest coding language. I know a bit of C#, but of course that is weak as well. If I am able to hone in more and become more proficient in these current coding languages, I’ll be able to build a lot more tools and resources in order to progress academically and artistically. SAIC does not have a specific coding class, but taking classes that involve some sort of programming or design will give me a good amount of knowledge in order for me to build projects surrounding those fields. 

    Some faculty that I know are aware/are involved in these spaces reside within the Art & Technology. Specifically <strong>Salvatore Cordova</strong> whose two classes I was a part of in the Fall ‘23 semester, gave me really good outlook on projects I can tackle in and outside of class. He has a very good amount of knowledge within C#, and he is a resource I can depend on heavily for the scope/structure of computer science projects. <strong>Nimo</strong> is also very well versed within building web art, as I also took his Net Art && Cultures class during the Fall. If I want to build up my music repertoire, I think addressing some local electronic artists would be very beneficial as well, getting into making music with live instruments would be great to boost the performance aspect within my work. There is a class that works with Max MSP, with would definitely help me combine my love of computers with my love of electronic music. 

    Although I touched on a few classes prior to this entry, I thing Programming for Sound: Synthesis with <strong>Shawn Decker</strong> will be a good class to take for the Fall 2024 semester. He might be someone I should talk to considering I want to make my own instruments and expand my acts. 
    
    <p class="yapping"> Another class I just got accepted into is the Web Design course within the viscom department. I think having my hands on more classes within computing will give me a broader sense of using technology within my practice and help rewire my brain to such a degree. Over the summer taking the UI/UX class would also be part of that journey, I just believe if this music stuff does not work out the way I want it to, having something lioke tech knowledge would be able to land me a job somewhere else. Maybe employers would be interested in hiring a web designer or front-end developer with an art degree, instead of hiring everyone with the same degree. 

    Coming this Aprill as I’m selecting new classes, I most likely see myself putting those three classes in my cart. </p>

        <h2>Future of Performance (Learning Abroad)</h2>
        <p class="yapping">This will most likely be the last entry I write before I "turn" this in. During <strong>Winter '24</strong> I want to go to Europe and perform and kick it with some oh my dawgs there. I have a couple homies in London and want to see if I can get booked to do a show over there, As someone who has built their own image up online since I was 16, it would be such an honor to be able to play out of the country. As of right now I have not even done a show outside of Chicago, over the summer I want to do a show outside of rthe cityt first at least. <br> Baby steps you know ╮(￣ω￣;)╭ 
            <br>
            But regardless of my current progress, having some sort of sonic performance outside of the country through the school seems unlikely right now. I just do not have the swag or like the EXP level to get the school to acknowldge the stuff I do outside of it. Maybe I should apply for more scholarships so I'm not broke as fuck outside ot graduation lol. Whatever
